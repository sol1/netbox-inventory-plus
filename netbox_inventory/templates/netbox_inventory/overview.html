        Create a new <a href="{% url 'plugins:netbox_inventory:supplier_add' %}">Supplier</a>. Not to be confused with
        Manufacturers, Suppliers are the <strong>vendors</strong> of the physical products your assets are based on.
        For example, if you have a Cisco switch from Cisco Australia, the supplier name would be 'Cisco Australia' and
        the slug would be 'cisco-australia'.`,

        html: `<strong>2. Create a BOM</strong><br>
        Create a new <a href="{% url 'plugins:netbox_inventory:bom_add' %}">BOM</a>. A BOM (Bill of Materials) is a
        list of assets with the intention of being purchased. BOMs are required to define a name and a status. If you
        are unsure on the BOM's status, 'Planned' is a good default. Click on the BOM's name to view its details 
        page.<br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> BOMs are not required to be created in order to create purchases. BOMs are a way to
        group assets together for the purpose of purchasing. If you are unsure if you need a BOM, you probably
        don't.`,

      },
      {
        html: `<strong>3. Create And Assign An Asset To The BOM</strong><br>
        This can be done easily in the BOM's details page. You should see two tables; one labelled
        <strong>Purchases</strong> and another labelled <strong>BOM Assets</strong>. Each table will have two buttons
        to the right of their headers; 'Create New' and 'Add Existing'. Click on <strong>Create New Asset</strong> to
        open the Asset creation form. You should notice the 'BOM' field on this form is automatically set to the one
        you just created. Assets are representations of devices, modules, racks or other inventory items in your
        network. Assets are required to define a device/module/inventory item/rack type and a status. If you are adding
        an asset to the BOM, you should set the status to 'Planned'. Once completed, click <strong>Create</strong> to
        create the Asset. You will be redirected to the BOM details page and the Asset you just created should now be
        listed in the <strong>BOM Assets</strong> table.`,

        On the BOM details page, click the <strong>Create New Purchase</strong> button on the
        <strong>Purchases</strong> table to create a new Purchase and automatically associate this BOM with it. The
        Purchase creation form will open and the BOM field will be set to the one you created earlier. Purchases are
        required to define a Supplier, a name, and a status. If you are unsure on the Purchase's status, 'Open' is a
        good default. Once completed, click on the Purchase to view its details page.`,

        On the Purchase details page, you should see three tables; <strong>BOMs</strong>, <strong>Deliveries</strong>,
        and <strong>Purchased Assets</strong>. The BOMs table should be assigned the BOM you created earlier. It is
        useful to think of a Purchase as a checklist for your BOMs, adding Assets as they are ordered. When an Asset is
        purchased, click the <strong>Assign Existing Assets</strong> button to add it to this Purchase. The list of
        Assets is filtered to only include those that are part of the associated BOM(s). Once assigned, you will notice
        that the Asset's status is updated to 'Ordered' automatically.`,

        Back on the Purchase details page, click the <strong>Create New Delivery</strong> button to create a Delivery
        and assign the current Purchase to it. You should see that the Purchase has automatically been added to the
        Purchases field in the form. Deliveries are also required to define a name. Once created, click on the Delivery
        in the table to go to its details page.<br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Though not required, it is recommended to set the Delivery's site and location fields to
        the site and location of where the Asset(s) are being delivered to.`,

        <strong>Delivered Assets</strong>. When an Asset is delivered, click the
        <strong>Assign Existing Assets</strong> button to add it to this Delivery. Like in step 5, the list of Assets
        here is filtered to only include the Assets that are part of the Delivery's assigned Purchase(s). Any Assets
        assigned from here will automatically have their status updated to 'Stored' and their storage_site and
        storage_location fields updated to the site and location of the Delivery.`,
